- There are 2 different models, a polynomial regression model (PolyRegression.py) and random forest model (RandomForest.py)
- Visualization.py is only used to graph the dataset used
## How to use:
For RandomForest.py:
- The file contains a function called 'predict_price', which takes the model and required features as parameters.
- ridge_poly_h, ridge_poly_t, and ridge_poly_u are used as the models for houses, townhouses, and units respectively
For RandomForest.py:
- The file also contains a function called 'predict_price'.
- rf_h, rf_t, and rf_u are used as the models for houses, townhouses, and units respectively
